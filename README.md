## Business Case

### Introduction
Secure file storage is a key concern in protecting sensitive data. A strong authentication method in the form of Single Sign-On (SSO), combined with end-to-end encryption, play an important role in keeping user data safe. Taking these measures into account can help ensure users upload are safe and the data is stored securely. Furthermore, sharing sensitive data can also benefit from these safeguards, allowing files to be exchanged with confidence that they remain protected throughout the process. 

### Problem Statement
The increasing need for digital platforms for file storage and sharing, has exposed sensitive data to potential security threats. This includes unauthorized access and data breaches, where traditional authentication methods often fall short in addressing these modern security challenges and unfortunately leaving the users data in a vulnerable state.
<br/>

To address these concerns, a robust solution is required that combines advanced authentication mechanisms and encryption techniques. By using OpenId Connect for secure Single Sign-On (SSO), together with implementing end-to-end encryption in the form of a hybrid approach, containing symmetric encryption for files and asymmetric encryption for keys, we aim to create a secure file storage and sharing environment, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root of the project `secure-cloud` and run the following command:
```
docker compose up --build
```
3. After composing the project, go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you are now ready to configure KeyCloak

## KeyCloak Setup Guide - secure-cloud
1. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and login with the following credentials:
```
USERNAME: admin
PASSWORD: admin
```
2. You are now logged in and ready to configure KeyCloak


### Clients

6. Add two web origins with the following:
```
http://localhost:8083
```
```
*
```
7. Press Save and then go to the `Credentials` tab.
8. Here you should copy and save the `Client Secret`, you will need this for your `.env` file later.

```
Key = inputType
Value = text
```
6. Now press create and the user profile configuration is done.
7. Under the realm settings, navigate to the next tab called `User registration` & click the `Assign role` button.
8. Scroll down until you find a role called `master-realm manage-users` with the description `role_manage-users`.

3. Press the button that checks all roles and assign all possible roles to the admin.
4. You are now done with configuring users üî•

## Environment Variables
- You have now set up KeyCloak, and the last step is to configure your `.env` files in the `secure-cloud-frontend` and `secure-cloud-backend`.

<br/> 

### secure-cloud-frontend 
1. In the `secure-cloud-frontend` folder, create a new file named `.env`.
2. In this file, the content should be as following: 
```
VITE_CLIENT_SECRET=G7jrxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
VITE_CLIENT_ID=secure-cloud
```
### secure-cloud-backend
1. In the `secure-cloud-backend` folder, create a new file named `.env`
2. In this file, the content should be as following:

```
CONNECTION_STRING="Host=secureclouddb;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=postgres;Database=SecureCloudDB"
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: To enable your .env files correctly and get the project to compose correctly!! ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Stop the Docker Container called `secure-cloud` - BUT DO NOT DELETE IT ‚ö†Ô∏è
2. Compose up again with the following command:
```
docker compose up --build
```

# You are now fully configured and ready to run the Secure Cloud üî•üî•üî•
