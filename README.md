## Business Case

### Introduction
Secure file storage is a key concern in protecting sensitive data. A strong authentication method in the form of Single Sign-On (SSO), combined with end-to-end encryption, play an important role in keeping user data safe. Taking these measures into account can help ensure users upload are safe and the data is stored securely. Furthermore, sharing sensitive data can also benefit from these safeguards, allowing files to be exchanged with confidence that they remain protected throughout the process. 

### Problem Statement
The increasing need for digital platforms for file storage and sharing, has exposed sensitive data to potential security threats. This includes unauthorized access and data breaches, where traditional authentication methods often fall short in addressing these modern security challenges and unfortunately leaving the users data in a vulnerable state.
<br/>

To address these concerns, a robust solution is required that combines advanced authentication mechanisms and encryption techniques. By using OpenId Connect for secure Single Sign-On (SSO), together with implementing end-to-end encryption in the form of a hybrid approach, containing symmetric encryption for files and asymmetric encryption for keys, we aim to create a secure file storage and sharing environment, ensuring data integrity and privacy.
